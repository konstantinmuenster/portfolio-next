Over the course of the last months, I had the opportunity to mentor a group of talented new web developers who participated in [TechLabs’ digital shaper program](https://techlabs.org/).

It was really fun to see the groups’ learning progress from zero to deployed application. While I was reviewing their first bits of code, it reminded me of my first years as a developer.

Especially if you are self-taught and don’t have any formal education, you just rock n roll. You don’t have any feeling for good or bad code practices. You are happy about anything that works.

This got me thinking: “Which coding principles do I wish I had known earlier?”. Well, here they are!

You can implement these simple tips in your coding practice right away. But although simple, they changed a lot in how I write code.

Note: The principles are applicable to all areas of programming, even though the title says ‘frontend developers’ specifically.

## 1. “Return Early” instead of nested conditions

In web development, you have a lot of situations in which you have to check if certain conditions are met.

Let’s take the example of an API route that validates a request and returns an user object:

```jsx
export const handler = async (req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST' || req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    const email = validateEmail(req.body.email);
    if (email) {
      const user = getUserByEmail(email);
      if (user) {
        return res.status(200).json({ user });
      } else {
        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'No user found' });
      }
    } else {
      return res.status(422).json({ message: 'Missing email' });
    }
  } else {
    return res.status(405).json({ message: 'Unsupported message' });
  }
};
```

Although we don’t have that much of logic incapsulated in this function, it already looks quite a bit cluttered. Specifically, there are two issues with this code:

1. It is hard to follow the flow of code. Instead of reading top-to-bottom, we need to read left-to-right ([Arrow-Anti-Pattern](http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrowAntiPattern)).
2. It is hard to figure out the corresponding _else_ for each **if**. They are separated by the big body of the if statement.

A simple technique to improve this code is to incorporate the **Return-Early-Pattern**.

The Return-Early-Pattern terminates the execution of functions when conditions are not met. So that the expected result of the function is always at the very end.

If we rewrite the API route from above, it would look like:

```jsx
export const handler = async (req, res) => {
  if (req.method !== 'POST' && !req.method !== 'OPTIONS') {
    return res.status(405).json({ message: 'Unsupported message' });
  }

  const email = validateEmail(req.body.email);
  if (!email) {
    return res.status(422).json({ message: 'Missing email' });
  }

  const user = getUserByEmail(email);
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'No user found' });
  }

  return res.status(200).json({ user });
};
```

With the Return-Early-Pattern in place, we can easily follow the code execution from top to bottom. Since we assume a happy path and only check for missing values, we avoid nesting too many conditions.

Lastly, we can see at first glance the expected outcome of the function at the very bottom.

## 2. Writing Code For Humans

Generalizing what we did in the previous tip leads us to the second principle: write code that’s easily read by your coworkers, not the machine.

This sounds trivial, but it changed my thinking tremendously at first.

When I started programming, I always perceived it as a way to communicate to the computer. We tell the machine what to do. Yet the code that we write is read by our coworkers - not the machine.

Our coworkers are the ones who need to read and understand the code. The computer in the end transpiles everything to 0s and 1s and does not care about readability.

Let’s take this `groupBy` function as an example:

```jsx
const groupBy = (arr, groupFn) =>
  arr.reduce(
    (grouped, obj) => ({
      ...grouped,
      [groupFn(obj)]: [...(grouped[groupFn(obj)] || []), obj],
    }),
    {}
  );
```

We clearly demonstrated that we can write complicated one-liner functions to do a simple operation: take an array and group it.

While this may let you feel a bit more senior, it for sure makes things harder to understand for anyone who needs to review this.

Consider this implementation instead:

```jsx
const groupBy = (arr, groupFn) => {
  const grouped = {};
  for (const obj of arr) {
    const groupName = groupFn(obj);
    if (!grouped[groupName]) {
      grouped[groupName] = [];
    }
    grouped[groupName].push(obj);
  }
  return grouped;
};
```

We can read it from top to bottom and instantly know what happens on every line.

It may not look as cool as the previous example - true! But everybody who revisits this function in the future will thank you for this readable implementation.

## 3. Hiding Information Behind Functions

The last idea to improve your code style as a junior developer is to hide irrelevant information behind functions. This also benefits readability.

If you are familiar with React, hooks are a great example for this principle:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendListItem(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }

    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>{props.friend.name}</li>
  );
}
```

Here, we have a component that outputs a list item with a dynamic status color. While this code executes perfectly fine, it incapsulates logic that is not directly related to the purpose of the `FriendListItem` component.

If we extract the logic and create a custom hook called `useFriendStatus`, we can simplify the component as follows:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendListItem(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>{props.friend.name}</li>
  );
}
```

This has two benefits:

1. We can reuse the `useFriendStatus` logic.
2. We simplified our component to what’s truly relevant for its functionality.

More generally, the principle of hiding information is to encapsulated irrelevant information behind abstract functions.

Thus, we do not have to care about what happens inside the abstract function (implementation details) - we can rather focus on its purpose, i.e. the function's name (level of problem domain).

I hope these small tips have been helpful to you! Essentially, writing better code is often just about making it more readable and easily understandable – for yourself and everyone else.
